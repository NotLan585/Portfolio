                This project was something that didn't need to be done, but I wanted to learn more about showing data in a easy to read way to whenever automation is ran. For this 
                I created a slackbot and setup the appropriate token/webhooks to post the message. When running the automation for the suite, I setup a autouse fixture to capture data at the end 
                of the test("passed/failed/skipped"/"Length of test in second") and used <a href='https://matplotlib.org/'>matplotlib</a> and plotted the data and subplots and used <a href='https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/'>slack_sdk</a> to upload the file and inlay it with the 
                main suite results. For the suite results(For the nightly automation) when running the nightly I `| tee results.txt` all the output to a .txt file and set a `after_script` in the pipeline
                to parse the file and use Slacks BlockKitBuilder to setup the payload to send the data of the outcome of the nightly automation.
                <br></br>
                I think the next thing I'll do for this project is more data such as amount of clicks or actions performed and continue to learn more about <a href='https://jupyter.org/'>Jupyter</a>

          <br>This project was the first I used <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/" target="_blank">Playwright</a> and set it up to choose a random Pokemon to battle with and notate the statistics of the Pokemon to a .json file.</br>
          This automation could be run headed/headless(Windowed or in the background).
          <br></br>
          What I want to do as I learn more is use the data and show win/lose ratios and maybe the probability of a certain Pokemon winning a battle.

          This was a project I setup for my wife because Lululemon had a craze for fanny packs, sorry belt bags... So I set up a web scraper to let me know when a specific kind was in stock/was
          able to ship and email me when it was.

        <p>
          Rock Paper Scissors was my first project, I wanted to create a game that would randomly select an option and give the user sass if they 
          input an option wrong too many times. 
          <br></br>
          I kinda want to use the data of wins/ties/losses and graph them to the user for win/lose ratios and what option
          had the best/worse result.

              This project is still a Work In Progress, but the idea would be to notify the user of any critical weather alerts for their current area
              and notify them via email or text.
